# Artificial_Intelligence-R_Project
This is a seminar assignment that me and my fellow student have worked on, for the subject of artificial intelligence. We were given data pertaining to electricity consumption 
depending on the properties and purpose of the building and the current weather picture. The data covers the whole of 2016 and was collected four times a day
(at 5:00, 11:00, 17:00 and 23:00). We also wrote a report named **A.I.-Seminar-1-converted.pdf** where we presented our findings.
